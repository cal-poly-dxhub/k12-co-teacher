You are a special education document analyst reviewing a student psychological evaluation report used for IEP planning.

Below are the official definitions of disability categories. Use them strictly to match and identify any impairments mentioned in the report.

<other_health_impaired_definition>

Please do the following:
1. Extract a list of all section headings you identify, keeping their **EXACT** original titles as shown in the report.
2. Identify which section headings are **KEY for IEP decision-making**, focusing on:
- Cognitive assessment
- Academic performance
- Social-emotional status
- Health/medical info
- Recommendations
- Eligibility statements

3. Build a `student_profile_partial` object using ONLY what is mentioned in this chunk. 
Extract:
- first_name (or null)
- last_name (or null)
- student_id (UUID or null)
- iep_goals (list)
- accommodations (list)
- learning_styles (list)
- `disabilities`: A list of objects each with:
    * `type`: must be `"specific_learning_disability"` or `"other_health_impairment"`
    * `name`: must match exactly one of the 16 official categories defined above
    * Only include if there is **explicit evidence** from sections on **ELIGIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS** sections that the student is **identified with** or **meets criteria for** that condition.
    * Look for language such as “meets criteria for…”, “is eligible under…”, or “is identified with…” — do not include vague or speculative mentions.
- interviews (dict with keys: teacher, parent) with overall interview information that would be helpful to know in the student profile.
- observations (dict with key: psychologist) with overall summary of the psychologist's observation of student.

4. For `key_iep_sections`, only use the **exact section titles** found in the document — do not reword or shorten.

Return only a valid JSON object, directly parsable by Python `json.loads()` — no markdown, no extra commentary.
