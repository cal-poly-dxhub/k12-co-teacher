The objective is for students to explain the causes and immediate effects of Black Tuesday and analyze how the stock market crash contributed to the onset of the Great Depression in the United States. The lesson will begin with a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation and lecture where students will take notes, followed by a 10-minute video to reinforce key concepts. Afterward, students will break into six groups, with each group responsible for creating a visual graphic and brief presentation on one of the causes of the crash. The six causes include: 1. Speculation and Buying on Margin 2. Overconfidence in the Stock Market 3. Lack of Regulation 4. Economic Inequality 5. Overproduction of Goods 6.
