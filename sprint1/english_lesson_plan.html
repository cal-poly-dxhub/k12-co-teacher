                By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
                <br>• Identify and analyze character traits using direct and indirect characterization techniques
                <br>• Support character analysis with specific textual evidence from the story
                <br>• Explain how character traits influence plot development and character relationships
                <br><br>This skill is essential for developing critical reading comprehension and will help students become more thoughtful readers who can understand deeper meanings in literature. Character analysis is a foundational skill that appears on state assessments and supports students' ability to make connections between literature and real life.

            <div class="section-content">
                Begin with a "People Watching" activity: Show students a photograph of two people interacting (without context). Ask them to write on sticky notes what they think each person is like based on their appearance, body language, and facial expressions. Have students share their observations and discuss how we make judgments about people's personalities. Connect this to how authors reveal character traits in stories—sometimes directly through description, and sometimes indirectly through actions, dialogue, and thoughts. Introduce today's learning objective and explain that we'll be character detectives analyzing Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones from "Thank You, M'am."

                <strong>Direct Instruction (15 minutes):</strong>
                <br>• Define direct vs. indirect characterization using examples from familiar characters

                <br>• Analyze her actions when Roger tries to steal her purse (indirect characterization)
                <br>• Make inferences about her character traits based on her dialogue: "Pick up my pocketbook, boy, and give it here"
                <br>• Record findings on the graphic organizer, showing how to cite page numbers and use quotation marks
                <br>• Think aloud my reasoning: "When Mrs. Jones says this, it shows she's authoritative and confident because..."

                <br>Students will read a short story of their choice from their independent reading book (or provided options) and complete a character analysis graphic organizer for the main character. Requirements:
                <br>• Identify 2 examples of direct characterization
                <br>• Identify 3 examples of indirect characterization using STEAL

                <br>• Include proper citations with page numbers
                <br><br><strong>Assessment:</strong> This assignment will be collected and graded using the character analysis rubric. Students who need additional support can choose from pre-selected shorter texts with guided questions.
